# Java Programming

This repository contains my collection of Java programs created while learning and practicing the fundamentals of Java programming.  
It serves as a personal record of progress — from understanding the basics of syntax and object-oriented principles to solving logical and algorithmic problems.

---

## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Strengthen my understanding of **core Java concepts**.  
- Develop **object-oriented programming** and **problem-solving skills**.  
- Maintain a **structured archive** of all practice programs and assignments.

Each program is written, compiled, and tested individually, focusing on readability, correctness, and adherence to standard Java practices.

---

## Topics Covered
- Basic Input and Output  
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
- Methods and Recursion  
- Arrays and Strings  
- Classes and Objects  
- Inheritance and Polymorphism  
- Exception Handling  
- File Handling *(upcoming)*  
- Collections Framework *(upcoming)*

## How to Compile and Run

### On Windows / Linux / macOS
```bash
javac Program.java
java Program

javac mypackage/Program.java
java mypackage.Program
```

## Future Scope

- Implementation of Object-Oriented Projects.

- Practice of Data Structures and Algorithms in Java.

- Exploring Java Collections Framework and Generics.

- Building mini-projects using Java (e.g., console-based applications).

- Transition towards problem-solving for competitive programming using Java.
